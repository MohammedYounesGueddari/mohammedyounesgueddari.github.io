**Hi, I'm Younes!** I am currently a 3rd Ph.D. student in mathematics at [Gustave Eiffel University](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/), working within the [LIGM lab](https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/home/) (Laboratoire d’Informatique Gaspard-Monge) under the supervision of [Jamal Najim](https://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~najim/) and [Walid Hachem](https://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~whachem/).

My main interests lie in probability theory and the study of problems arising in high-dimensional settings. It is this interest that led me to explore topics such as random matrix theory, complex systems, and high-dimensional inference, which currently shape my research. As an example, I study models from theoretical ecology, where I use probabilistic and asymptotic methods to understand species coexistence and stability in large ecosystems.

Beyond my research, I am actively involved in mathematics outreach and education. Since 2018, I have contributed to training and mentoring students for international math competitions through the [Math&Maroc](https://www.mathmaroc.org/) association. I have also organized many events within the association: [MTYM](https://mtym.mathmaroc.org/fr), [MDM](https://mdm.mathmaroc.org/), [MMC](https://mmc.mathmaroc.org/en), etc. You can find more details about these activities in the [Math&Maroc](/mathmaroc/) section.
