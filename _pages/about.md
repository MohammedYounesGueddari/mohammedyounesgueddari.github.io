I am a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Université Gustave Eiffel, working within the [LIGM laboratory](https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/home/) (Laboratoire d’Informatique Gaspard-Monge) under the supervision of [Jamal Najim](https://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~najim/) and [Walid Hachem](https://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~whachem/). 

My main interests lie in probability theory and the study of problems arising in high-dimensional settings. It is this interest that led me to explore topics such as random matrix theory, complex systems, and high-dimensional inference, which currently shape my research. As an example, I study models from theoretical ecology, where I use probabilistic and asymptotic methods to understand species coexistence and stability in large ecosystems.
